This is a fork from [wilix-team/iohook](https://github.com/wilix-team/iohook). Since it no longer provides prebuild binary for new version Node.js and Electron, and not support Apple m1 (a.k.a amd64, aarch64), so I forked the project, provided prebuild binary files (based on iohook v0.9.3) and posted it to npm.

Just install it and it should work for you:

```text
npm install @hcfy/iohook
```
